1
0:0:0,000 --> 0:0:3,000
If you only have 24 hours in a day, your

2
0:0:3,000 --> 0:0:7,000
success is dependent upon how you use the 24.

3
0:0:8,000 --> 0:0:10,000
You got to hear me, people talk about Oprah Winfrey,

4
0:0:10,000 --> 0:0:13,000
you know, Ted Turner, Warren Buffett. Listen to me. I

5
0:0:13,000 --> 0:0:15,000
don't care how much money you make. You only get

6
0:0:15,000 --> 0:0:18,000
24 hours in a day. In a difference between over

7
0:0:18,000 --> 0:0:22,000
and the person that's broke is over uses her 24

8
0:0:22,000 --> 0:0:27,000
hours wisely. That's it to me. That's it. You get

9
0:0:27,000 --> 0:0:30,000
24. I don't care. You broke, you grew up, bro.

10
0:0:30,000 --> 0:0:32,000
I don't care if you grew up rich. I don't

11
0:0:32,000 --> 0:0:34,000
care if you're in college, you're not in college. You

12
0:0:34,000 --> 0:0:37,000
only get 24 hours and I blew up.

13
0:0:39,000 --> 0:0:42,000
I went from being a high school dropout to selling

14
0:0:42,000 --> 0:0:44,000
6,000 books in less than six months. What happened? My

15
0:0:44,000 --> 0:0:47,000
24 hours. I was like, okay. Are you got to

16
0:0:47,000 --> 0:0:49,000
get a grip on your 24 hours? Because you bought

17
0:0:49,000 --> 0:0:51,000
to be broke for the rest of your life and

18
0:0:51,000 --> 0:0:52,000
it just all I need you to do. For me.

19
0:0:52,000 --> 0:0:54,000
I can tell you all about your life. If you

20
0:0:54,000 --> 0:0:57,000
just write down your 24-hour schedule for me. You let

21
0:0:57,000 --> 0:0:58,000
me look at it. I can tell you where you

22
0:0:58,000 --> 0:0:59,000
going to be in five years. I can tell you

23
0:0:59,000 --> 0:1:1,000
when you going to continue, I could tell you when

24
0:1:1,000 --> 0:1:2,000
you going to be 20 years, if you keep that

25
0:1:2,000 --> 0:1:3,000
schedule.
